# SSTimer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of March 13, 2025, riot stopped allowing the use of ultimate timers. While this doesn't affect SSTimer, please use this app with caution. There is no way in knowing whether or not summoner spell timers will be prohibited.

Helps you track champion's summoner spells. :D

Low memory (compared to porofessor) usage. ~100mb of RAM needed. And 260 mb disk size.

# Status

ðŸŸ¢ - Done! - Bugfixes will still happen!

# Installation

1. Download from releases (latest)
2. Unzip the folder
